# 🧠 Predicting House Prices with Simple Linear Regression

This project demonstrates how to build a simple linear regression model to predict house prices using Python and Scikit-learn. It follows the entire data science workflow—from data loading and exploration, to training, evaluating, and visualizing a model based on house area (square footage). The dataset used contains just two columns: `area` and `price`, making it a great entry point into supervised learning.

> 🎓 **Goal:** Learn the foundations of linear regression and produce a clean, portfolio-ready project.
